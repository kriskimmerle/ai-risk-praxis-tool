# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving the AI Risk Praxis tool.

* **Scope** – I plan to keep this project active through **December 2025**. After that I will archive the repo.
* **Pull requests** – Open an issue first so we can confirm the change fits the six-month roadmap. Small fixes and clear wording tweaks are easiest for me to merge quickly.
* **Tech stack** – Pure HTML, vanilla JS, and inline CSS. Please follow the existing style and keep dependencies to zero.
* **License** – By contributing, you agree your code and content are released under the MIT License.
* **Response time** – I review contributions as bandwidth allows. If I am slow to reply, feel free to ping the thread after a week.

That is it. Thanks again for helping practitioners understand AI risks a little faster.
